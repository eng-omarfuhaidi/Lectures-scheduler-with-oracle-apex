# Lectures-scheduler-with-oracle-apex
This repository contains an explanatory PDF report (download the report to view it) explaining an experimental system for generating an automatic weekly lecture schedule free of conflicts (time conflicts, hall conflicts, etc.). The system has been automated to create tables and allocate them based on several restrictions, which are as follows:


- No two courses are scheduled in the same room during the same time period.
- No two items are scheduled for the same group during the same time period.
- No lecturer may teach two subjects during the same time period.
- The course will be taught in the appropriate type of hall.
- The course will be taught in a hall with enough seats for the number of students at the level.
